Directories
If you installed via the package manager, the data directory /var/lib/mongodb and the log directory /var/log/mongodb are created during the installation.

sudo service mongod status
sudo service mongod stop

mongosh:
The MongoDB Shell, mongosh , is a fully functional JavaScript and Node.
REPL environment for interacting with MongoDB deployments. 
You can use the MongoDB Shell to test queries and operations directly with your database. 
mongosh is available as a standalone package in the MongoDB download center.

MongoDB connection:

The underlying MongoDB driver has deprecated their current connection string parser. 
Because this is a major change, they added the useNewUrlParser flag to allow users to fall back to the old parser if they find a bug in the new parser. 
You should set useNewUrlParser: true unless that prevents you from connecting.

the Unified Topology paradigm moves away from the concept of "connecting" and instead simply sets up a connection string and begins doing operations. 
Each operation then fails or succeeds depending on whether the driver can reach a server at the time that operation is executed
